Over the next month I plan to familiarize myself with the big 3 (ish) of front-end frameworks.  Part of this will be covered in class and used on some manner or project.  But I firmly believe that being familiar with VUE, React and Ember individually will increase my understanding and competency with them collectively.  To that end:

1. Spend 4-6 hours working on an Ember tutorial with the goal of building a full app
	*  make note of difficulties or hangups
	*  reflect on the process after completion. What did I like, what did I hate?

2. Spend 4-6 hours working on an VUE tutorial with the goal of building a full app
	*  make note of difficulties or hangups
	*  reflect on the process after completion. What did I like, what did I hate?
3. Spend 4-6 hours working on a React tutorial with the goal of building a full app
	*  make note of difficulties or hangups
	*  reflect on the process after completion. What did I like, what did I hate?
4.  If time allows, select a suitable project (emulating front end faceoff??????) and build each with my newfound skills.
	*  make note of difficulties or hangups
	*  reflect on the process after completion. What did I like, what did I hate?
5. Reflect on the process with a view towards identifying which of the frameworks feels most comfortable and intuitive to me.

	- after spending time with all of these frameworks I have some mixed feelings.  Primarily, this is because there are elements of each that I really enjoy.  I love the power and varied degree of support that Ember provides with things like Ember Data, Ember Fire etc.  I love the ease of development that its CLI adds.  I really enjoy React's speed and power and flexibility; things that I feel that VUE largely shares.
	At the end of the day i'm interested in continuing to learn all of the frameworks and digging in to each of their quirks.  I think there is a strong case to be made that each has a niche that it really excels in and that having a reasonable degree of skill broadens the types of projects you are equiped to take on.  That said, I think that React is the dominant force in the market currently and as a job seeker it makes the most sense to highlight my competency in this area.
