Over the next month I plan to familiarize myself with the big 3 (ish) of front-end frameworks.  Part of this will be covered in class and used on some manner or project.  But I firmly believe that being familiar with Angular, React and Ember individually will increase my understanding and competency with them collectively.  To that end:

1. Spend 4-6 hours working on an Ember tutorial with the goal of building a full app
	*  make note of difficulties or hangups
	*  reflect on the process after completion. What did I like, what did I hate?

2. Spend 4-6 hours working on an Angular tutorial with the goal of building a full app
	*  make note of difficulties or hangups
	*  reflect on the process after completion. What did I like, what did I hate?
3. Spend 4-6 hours working on a React tutorial with the goal of building a full app
	*  make note of difficulties or hangups
	*  reflect on the process after completion. What did I like, what did I hate?
4.  If time allows, select a suitable project (emulating front end faceoff??????) and build each with my newfound skills.
	*  make note of difficulties or hangups
	*  reflect on the process after completion. What did I like, what did I hate?
5. Reflect on the process with a view towards identifying which of the frameworks feels most comfortable and intuitive to me.
