*Pair Programming Excercise*

		Calvin and I pair programmed the pixel art scrim this past Friday; with myself primarily navigating
while he drove the code.  I think that in theory we would have both benefitted from periodically switching roles during the scrimmage; I think we both got a lot out of the experience.  For me personally the biggest take away was the immense value of talking through problems as you encountered them.  Having another set of eyes working through the code made it incredibly important that we communicated where we were and how we wanted to proceed.  This in turn encouraged us to discuss the code in detail as we were writing it.  The result was that we consistently had a very clear understanding of where out code currently was.

	Constantly talking through our code had two main benefits for me: we were only tackling one verynarrow
problem; and we were unable to frantically multitask between problems.  We were forced to see one task through to the end before moving on to something else.  This made it much easier to manage the scope of what we were working on and prevented the feeling of being overwhelmed by the project from setting in.

	Before this experiment in pair programming I was somewhat skeptical of the idea— I’ve historically
tend to prefer working on problems myself so I can avoid any feeling of pressure.  But actually working on code with another person— having another brain grinding at problems we encountered and another set of eyes checking for syntax errors— made the experience more enjoyable and really minimized pain-points and frustration.  It also created a feeling of shared victory every time we overcame a problem or made significant progress with our code.
