<p> Recently I was lucky enough to spend a few days working with James Schultz and helping him to teach a group of twelve students in one
 of Galvanize’s Javascript Fundamentals classes.  This class consisted of 8 sessions over two weeks and is designed to introduce
  students to, predictably enough, the fundamentals of JavaScript and jQuery, along with an introduction to the HTML and CSS elements
	 that are necessary to really see the power of JavaScript.
 <p> In many ways, this two week course mirrors the entire first quarter of the Web Development Immersive that I am working through and my
 initial reaction on walking into the classroom for the second session was a sense of awe that these students (mostly younger kids but
	 a few older gentlemen as well) were going to be covering so much ground so quickly.  My second reaction — after spending a few
	  minutes looking over the curriculum and zeroing in on what they would be learning during that session — was a kind of warm glow at
		 the realization that just a few months ago this would have all been utterly over my head.

<p> And I was getting ready to try and help teach these people.  It was exciting and a little bit nerve wracking —there was always a sense
 that maybe I wouldn’t be able to answer the next question asked of me — but it was also deeply satisfying to watch students, eyes
  wide and uncomprehending when concepts were introduced to them, wrestle with, and grasp, and master, the things that they were
	 learning.  Spending just a few hours working with these students I can definitely see the allure of teaching professionally; being
	  able to regularly watch student’s eyes brighten into focus when something clicks could definitely be addictive.  

<p> So it would be an understatement to say that I enjoyed my time working with James.  Not only because it was gratifying to help people
 learn, and nice to give back to the Galvanize community.  Partially because it felt amazing to try and inspire the same enthusiasm
  and excitement for learning that the Galvanize faculty has done such a fantastic job enkindling in me; and partially because it was a
  powerful reminder of just how far I’ve come in such a short time.  Not to mention how overwhelming all of these things felts in the
	 moment.  Remembering how hard it was to wrestle with problems that now seem straightforward is extremely helpful as I try to
	 mentally prepare for Q3 in my own program.
