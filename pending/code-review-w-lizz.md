# Code Review With the Inestimable Lizz Robbins

* Really great job of indentation and overall readability of code due to separation and formatting.

* Mix of fatty arrow functions and explicitly declared functions kind of throws me off.  Either way is awesome, just pick one and stick with it!  I have this same problem

* I really liked separating queries into distinct functions whenever they required more than a single step; it made it easy to follow the code without getting lost in the details

* Strong semantic naming made it easy to jump from code to queries and back without getting confused or lost.

## Feedback received from Lizz

3 positives:
- Had error handlers in app.js
- Added in comments to help understand the purpose of the code block
- Great use of a join table!

1 thing to improve:
- Break out routes into queries for cleaner code

## Takeaways

* There aren't distinct 'right' or 'wrong' ways to approach a lot of the problems we face as programmers/developers.  There are a variety of approaches and as long as you've thought through why you take the path you do it can be valid.

* different developers are going to have distinct styles and approaches and its important to be flexible and approaching reading, and writing, code to help you work with a variety of different styles

* having another set of eyes on your code can always give you perspective; whether you change your approach or not it forces you to think it through and defend your approach or adopt a new one.
