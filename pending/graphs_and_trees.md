# Describing Graphs and also Trees

Trees are a type of data structure best suited to holding hierarchical data.  Trees begin with a starting data point (more commonly called nodes) called the root.  From the root additional nodes are linked through edges in a child-parent relationship.  Crucially, a node may have multiple children, but no node may have more than one parent.  This means that there is a always a definitive root node.  

In contrast, graphs are a data structure that set aside many of the restrictions and limitations of data trees.  While they are still formed up of nodes and edges, graphs may have either directed or undirected edges, meaning that there is not necessarily a strict parent-child relationship between nodes.  Additionally, this does away with the limitations regarding how many nodes may be linked together, meaning that there may not be a definitive starting or root node.
