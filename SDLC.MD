SDLC, or the software development life cycle, is, suprisingly enough, a description of the phases a piece of software will go through during its lifecycle.  This includes:

* planning the scope of the software, including investigating and analysisng its potential use cases, costs, problems etc.
* building and developing the software
* testing the software and implementing fixes
* deploying, maintaining and supporting the software after it has been deployed.

It is worth noting that the SDLC is cyclical and none of the above phases or stages can ever really be considered 'finished' or 'complete'.

In and of itself, the SDLC give no guidance as to how these different phases should be managed or approached.  This, instead, is the realm of software development methodologies such as Agile or Waterfall.  

For example, Agile as a methodology is primarily focused on flexibility and continuous delivery.  This informs and Agile team's approach to operating within the SDLC, potentially moving each individual user story through the entirety of the SDLC, creating continuous delivery of small slices of software.  An agile team would also more open to change, continuously jumping from phase to phase as needed, and frequently reprioritizing user stories according to changing circumstances.
