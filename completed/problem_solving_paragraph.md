## Problem Solving Companion Paragraph
Dealing with errors can be a fun combination of amusing and infuriating.  In our original problem our if/then loop is a walking error statement, and even after we've 'fixed' the syntax we still throw two more errors before getting things cleaned up.
	While my approach to overcoming errors may change as my time at Galvanize goes on for the time being it begins with very very carefully combing my code for typographical errors.  90% of the time, the issue is not with the tool I am trying to use, or with bringing the wrong tool to bear on the problem, but with how I've written it.  Often this entails comparing what I've written to example code in order to diagnose issues.  In the rare instances that I've been unable to solve the problem this way it has been necessary to reset my problem solving, determine whether I'm actually using the right tool for the job and continue researching to find additional information to help solve the problem.
