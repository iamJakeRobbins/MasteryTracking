# November Dember Ember Meetup!

This past wednesday I attended the monthly Ember meetup organized by our very own Kyle Coberly.  The meetup primarily consisted of a livestream of a Q&A session held in Boston with several members of the core Ember development team.  

While its safe to say that the majority of what was discussed went over my head it was still a very interesting experience.  Listening to core members speak about the things they'd accomplished over the past year and what they were looking forward to in 2018 gave me a really good jumping off point for independent research and study (things like glimmer.js, WASM, web assembly).  Listening to the reactions of longtime members of the meetup also gave me a lot of insight into what seperates Ember from other popular frameworks like React.  

I had hoped that going to this meetup would help me decide what front end framework I wanted to try and learn first; i've had an interest in Ember since the beginning o the program largely due to Kyle's enthusiasm for it.  I don't know that I can say that attending made things any clearer or helped me make a decision about frameworks.  But the sense of community around Ember is infectious and Kyle's enthusiasm seemed genuinely shared not only by local attendees but by the people on the livestream as well.  That, more than anything else, got me excited about potentially diving into Ember at some point in the future.
